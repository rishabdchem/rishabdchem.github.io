      I mention some of my past research experiences below. 

      <h2>Yale University</h2>

      <b>Electronic structure calculations with bosons.</b> 
      A rapidly progressing field in quantum hardware is the circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) 
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/RevModPhys.93.025005">approach</a>,
      where microwave resonators act as quantum harmonic oscillators and the bosonic quantum 
      gates are implemented by 
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0183022">coupling</a>
      the resonators with a superconducting transmon qubit. 
      This hybrid qubit-oscillator hardware approach has many advantages over the traditional 
      qubit-based quantum devices such as more control over noise and has been applied to
      study various bosonic problems in 
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00544">chemistry</a>.
      We have <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c01400">shown</a>
      for the first time how the universality of qubit-oscillator devices 
      allows us to represent the electronic structure Hamiltonian on bosonic 
      quantum computers and explore native qubit-qumode gates to represent ground states 
      of molecular electronic structure.
      We have also <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04727">shown</a>
      how to use the tower of Fock basis states of the qumode oscillators 
      to encode molecular excited states. 

      <p></p>
      <b>Bosonic gates for quantum optimization algorithms.</b> 
      We explored the potential of bosonic qumode gates further for optimization problems. 
      The Hamiltonians in this case are diagonal in nature, which allows us to compute 
      expectation vlaues by measuring the number of photons 
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevX.10.021060">inside</a>
      a microwave resonator.
      It is known that native qumode gates such as phase space displacement operators 
      are <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10381">hard</a>
      to mimic using qubit-centric gates. 
      We have shown for the first time that the expressiveness of such qumode gates coupled to a qubit 
      can <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11735">outperform</a>
      qubit-centric ansatz circuits for benchmark constrained optimization problems.

      <h2>Rice University</h2>

      <b>Classical computing methods for electron pairing.</b> 
      It is known that electron pairing in the Hilbert space of a suitable one-electron basis 
      is <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3613706">critical</a>
      for understanding strongly correlated electronic systems. 
      However, exactly solving the electronic structure problem on a 
      paired basis is still an impractical problem beyond a certain system size. 
      My thesis work asked the question: Is it possible to develop classical computing algorithms
      that can efficiently tackle strong correlation when the problem is only restricted to the 
      subspace where the electrons are paired? We have shown that the answer is yes for certain 
      flavors of strongly correlated pairing interactions by developing pair wavefunctions 
      inspired by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1953.0198">chemical bonding</a> 
      and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.108.1175">superconductivity</a>. 
      These newly developed electronic structure methods started from the so-called 
      antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) wavefunction where all the pairs were 
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1704794">identical</a>, 
      and then brought more  
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.0c00807">diversity</a> 
      to different electron pairs, which can also be 
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0045006">selectively</a> tuned.

      <p></p>
      <b>Quantum state preparation algorithms.</b> 
      Electron pairs are isomorphic to qubits due to their shared Lie algebraic structure. 
      This allows AGP to be understood as a multi-qubit state with unique entanglement properties. 
      The elementary symmetric polynomial (ESP) structure of the AGP allowed us to develop an 
      efficient quantum state preparation 
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.3c00525">algorithm</a>
      for the qubit-AGP state with potential applications in quantum optimization. 
      Exploration of the polynomial structure of AGP also allowed us to develop a polynomial 
      that generalizes the notion of ESP and allowed us to design a quantum state with more 
      flexibility than AGP. We have shown the resulting binary tree state (BTS) can be 
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0185375">efficiently</a>
      simulated on a classical computer, thus introducing a quantum-inspired classical algorithm.
