      I am a theoretical chemist with expertise in quantum mechanics, linear algebra, 
      scientific computing, and science communication.
      I am currently a Computational Scientist in the Physical Sciences Division at 
      Pacific Northwest National Laboratory 
      (<a href="https://www.pnnl.gov">PNNL</a>). 
      As a member of the Quantum Algorithms and Architecture for Domain Science
      (<a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/quantum-algorithms-and-architecture-domain-science-quaads">QuAADS</a>) 
      initiative, I develop quantum algorithms and uncover the behavior of quantum systems 
      to solve a broad range of scientific challenges in chemistry and beyond. 

    <p></p>
      I was previously a Postdoctoral Associate in the Department of Chemistry at 
      <a href="https://www.yale.edu">Yale University</a>. 
      As a member of the
      <a href="https://batistalab.com/">Batista lab</a>, 
      one of my research interests was to explore the potential of 
      hybrid qubit-oscillator quantum computers for chemistry. 
      I led the development of the first electronic structure 
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c01400">algorithm</a> 
      that can be implemented using bosonic quantum oscillators coupled to qubits. 

    <p></p>
      I have a Ph.D. in Chemistry from 
      <a href="https://www.rice.edu">Rice University</a>, 
      where I was a member of the   
      <a href="http://scuseria.rice.edu/">Scuseria group</a>. 
      My doctoral <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/1911/115253">thesis</a> 
      focused on developing quantum many-body methods tailored for 
      strongly correlated paired fermionic and spin-1/2 systems.
      I helped develop 
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpca.3c00525">generalizations</a> 
      of the Dicke state and the elementary symmetric polynomial, 
      which inspired me to coin the term 
      <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0185375">binary tree state</a>.

      More details on my research contributions is discussed on the 
      <a href="pages/research.html">Research</a> page. 
      The <a href="pages/publications.html">Publications</a> 
      page contains the links to the open-access preprint versions of my publications.
